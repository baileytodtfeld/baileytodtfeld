She graduated with Distinction from the University of Michigan in 2024, where she majored in Psychology and minored in the History of Medicine and Health. At the University of Michigan, Bailey worked in the [Social Minds Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/warneken/), where she researched the conceptual development of reciprocity, perceptions of fairness, and helping behaviors in children, among other tenets of developmental psychology. She also held several clinical roles, including working as an ABA technician and serving as a peer facilitator with the [Wolverine Support Network](https://www.umichwsn.org/).

Bailey is highly interested in child psychology, with a specific passion for examining the role of the parent-child relationship in the onset, course, and treatment of child mental health conditions. Bailey is also passionate about therapeutic allianceâ€”particularly how a positive alliance can be fostered with both parent and child, and how this relationship influences outcomes in therapy modalities involving the family structure. She plans to pursue a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology to investigate these topics, among other facets of her wide-reaching interests within psychology.
